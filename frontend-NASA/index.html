      <h1 class="center-txt bold-txt big-txt header-txt">What challanges do Astronauts face daily</h1>
      <p class="center-txt mid-txt">
        Astronauts have a very challanging job. 
        they spend many months away from their famillies and friends in the 
        hope of advancing our understanding of space and the impacts of zero gravity has on peoples lives.
      </p>
      <p class="mid-txt">Some of these challanges include:</p>
      <ul class="mid-txt">
        <li>Lack of physical exercise causing muscle and bone deteroration</li>
        <li>Overwork with 16 hour shifts and everyday being on call</li>
        <li>Lack of social connection leading to depression</li>
        <li>Home sickness / Real sickness</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="center-txt mid-txt">
        From what we found so far the games on the international space station 
        are ones that have no real objective or competitive aspect that solves all the issues that
        that are present in the list of problems.
      </p>

    <section id="solution">
      <h1 class="center-txt bold-txt big-txt header-txt">How Does Astro Ball Solve These Issues</h1>
      <p class="mid-txt center-txt">
        Astro Ball aims the use the microgravity enviroment to create a dynamic game 
        that is simple to understand and solve many issues that astronaughts face. the premise
        is for two opposing players to throw the ball towards the other players direction but no directly at them.
      </p>
      <ul class="mid-txt">
        <li>Astro Ball requires the users move around the room they in order to catch the ball requiring physical movement</li>
        <li>Astro Ball creates friendly competition between the players which creates social interaction</li>
        <li>Astro Ball is not very brain intesive allowing the players to unwind for a little</li>
        <li>Astro Ball is not a long game so it fits in the 1 hour time limit</li>
        <li>Astro Ball is similar to games down on earth reliving home sickness</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mid-txt center-txt">
        Sometimes less is more. astronaughts are already busy enough. The ideal game should be simple and fun.
      </p>

      <h1 class="center-txt bold-txt big-txt header-txt">The Rules</h1>
      <p class="mid-txt center-txt">
